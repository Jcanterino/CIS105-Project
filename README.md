# CIS105-Project
The concept for the project was to work with Matt Rafferty's keylogger.
We needed a way to transfer the text file created from one computer to another.
The server file must be running on a seperate machine in order to connect to the client that will be sending the text file.
I initially planned on using the email file, but scrapped that idea due to issues with the smtp servers preventing me from signing in through python.
Instead we can use ports to transfer the data from one machine to another.
